# Swamp Services: Students Helping Students
Students are faced with all sorts of challenges these days that cause a lot of unnecessary challenges to their studies. Some of these challenges include needing help with food, help with their pets, feeling alone or bullied, help with small finances, home utility or car repairs, moving, and finding a tutor/mentor. We are building a community service website that allows students to volunteer some of their time to help other students who may be facing some of these challenges. The volunteer students would provide quick services like helping them with a meal plan, cooking, walking/feeding their dogs, being available to talk when in need, and helping with resumes and job searches.


**FOR** (target customer) - students on the UF campus who need help.
**WHO** (statement of the need or opportunity) -  It fulfills the need of students for a safe, reliable, free service on the UF campus.
The (**PRODUCT NAME**) is a (product category) - Swamp Services.
**THAT** (key benefit, compelling reason to buy) - Students can earn Gator Points redeemable in the campus stores while gaining community service hours and building a sociable community through the outreach and response facilitated through the website.
**UNLIKE** (primary competitive alternative) - Unlike craigslist, Swamp Services provides a free, safe alternative to existing service marketplaces.
**OUR PRODUCT** (statement of primary differentiation) - Our product differs from competitors because it is solely based on the UF campus and is made for the students who are verified. Our site provides volunteer/social opportunities to UF students. 

Because Swamp Services needs UFID to access, if any crime or harassment occurs, the culprit will be easy to identify. The UFID access also excludes non-students from accessing the services and should provide a measure of safety.
